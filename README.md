# How to use current python code to generate problem

The `main.py` file shows how to generate a problem. Suppose you wanted to generate problem that abides by the archetype identifier 10. Then you would write code that looks like the following:


```
def generate_problem(archetype_id):
    rg = RandomProblemGenerator()
    

    p = rg.get_archetype(arch_num)
    tc = TemplateChooser(arch_num, p)

    return tc.get_p_text(), tc.get_q_text()


if __name__ == '__main__':
	arch_num = 10
    premise, question = generate(arch_num)
    print (premise)
    print (question)
```
